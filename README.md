Title : Understanding Operators and Conditional Statements of C++

# Operators in C++
In C++, operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. They form the backbone of most computations and logic building in any C++ program.

There are several types of operators, and the ones used in this assignment include:

1. Arithmetic Operators
These are used for basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

+ : Addition
- : Subtraction
* : Multiplication
/ : Division
In our program, arithmetic operators are used to calculate the average marks of subjects.

2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
These operators are used to compare two values. The result of the comparison is either true or false.

== : Equal to
!= : Not equal to
< : Less than
> : Greater than
<= : Less than or equal to
>= : Greater than or equal to
For example, we use them to check the range of average marks to assign grades.

3. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.

&& : Logical AND
|| : Logical OR
! : Logical NOT
They are especially useful when we want to check multiple conditions together, such as whether a point lies in a particular quadrant.

4. Assignment Operator
= : Used to assign a value to a variable.
Example: average = (m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5) / 5;

# Conditional Statements in C++
Conditional statements allow us to make decisions in a program. They execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. In this assignment, we’ve used:

if
else if
else
These help guide the program flow based on inputs, such as checking if a number is positive or negative, or determining the quadrant of a coordinate.

# Summary of Programs
# 1. Grade Calculator
This program takes marks of five subjects from the user, calculates the average, and displays the corresponding grade using if-else conditions.

SampleOutput Enter marks of subject 1: 56
Enter marks of subject 2: 78
Enter marks of subject 3: 98
Enter marks of subject 4: 65
Enter marks of subject 5: 45
Average: 68.4
The grade is: C


Key Concepts Used:

Arithmetic operations
Average calculation
Multiple if-else blocks
Relational and logical operators


# 2. Finding whether a number is positive, negative or zero
This simple program checks whether the entered number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional logic.

SampleOutput
Enter a number: -98
The number is negative

 Key Concepts Used:

Basic condition checking
if-else structure
Use of comparison operators

# 3. Quadrant Locator
This program determines in which quadrant a point lies on the Cartesian plane, based on its x and y coordinates. It also handles edge cases like origin or axes.

Sample Output
Value of x is: -12
Value of y is: -12
(x,y) is in 3rd Quadrant

Concepts Used:

Compound conditions using &&
Multiple else if branches
Understanding real-world geometry through logic

# Conclusion
This assignment helped me get comfortable with using different types of operators and conditional statements in C++. By writing small programs that mirror real-life logic (like grading, checking number signs, or coordinate analysis), I got hands-on practice in building decision-based code — which is a foundational skill in programming.
